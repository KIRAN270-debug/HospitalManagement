Hospital Management System
Overview
The Hospital Management System is an advanced, user-friendly platform designed to streamline hospital operations and improve workflow efficiency. Developed by Kiran Sebastian, this system uses Java for the backend, integrating with MySQL/PostgreSQL for efficient data management. It allows hospital staff to easily manage patient records, staff information, medical inventory, and hospital branches.

With a robust backend built using the Spring Framework and Hibernate ORM, this system ensures smooth data handling, optimized performance, and scalability. The system also provides a comprehensive user interface for hospital staff to interact with.

Features
User Management: Admins can register, update, and manage hospital staff and user roles.
Patient Records Management: Maintain detailed patient records, including medical history and encounters.
Medical Inventory: Track medical items used in the hospital, from medicines to equipment.
Branch Management: Organize hospital branches, addresses, and associated information.
Medical Orders: Manage medical orders, track items, and generate reports.
Observations and Encounters: Manage patient encounters and doctor observations efficiently.
Technologies Used
Java: Core language for backend development.
Spring Framework: Provides a robust backend architecture for efficient management.
Hibernate ORM: Facilitates object-relational mapping for seamless interaction with the database.
MySQL/PostgreSQL: Database systems used for storing hospital data.
JDBC: Database connectivity for efficient query execution.
JUnit: Testing framework to ensure reliability and quality of the system.
Git: Version control for code management and collaboration.
Project Development Period
Development Tools: Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA, GitHub for version control.
